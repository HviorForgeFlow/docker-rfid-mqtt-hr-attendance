- Place in this folder the files you want to upload to the ESP8266 File System

- Open the Arduino project "uploadFS.ino" (it is empty, but for clearance I decided to create the data folder apart from the other project parts).

- In the Arduino IDE, make sure you have selected a board, port, and closed Serial Monitor

- In the menu bar, select Tools > ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload. 

This should start uploading the files into ESP8266 flash file system. When done, IDE status bar will display SPIFFS Image Uploaded message.
